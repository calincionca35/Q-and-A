What is...

## INSTANTIATION

Instantiation is the creation of an instance of an abstraction, object class (also known as a template) or other computer process whereby objects are used. Each instance created by instantiation is unique depending on the variation of the elements within the object. Until an object becomes instantiated, none of the code within the relevant class declarations is used. (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26857/instantiate)

## React
A React component should use props to store information that can be changed, but can only be changed by a different component.

A React component should use state to store information that the component itself can change.
